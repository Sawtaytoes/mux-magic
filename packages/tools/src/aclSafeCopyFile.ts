/**
 * Copies a single file's bytes from `source` to `destination` via a
 * stream pipeline. Equivalent to GNU `cp` without flags: data only,
 * no mode preservation, no timestamp preservation, no ownership
 * preservation.
 *
 * Built to work around an EPERM that `node:fs.copyFile` and
 * `node:fs.cp` hit on TrueNAS ZFS datasets configured with
 * `aclmode=restricted`. libuv's internal copyfile path calls
 * `fchmod()` on the destination after the data copy to preserve the
 * source's mode bits, and that chmod fails against NFSv4 ACLs even
 * when the mode is unchanged. Streaming the bytes never invokes
 * chmod, so the copy goes through.
 *
 * Files only — does not handle directory copies. The destination's
 * parent directory must already exist; callers are expected to
 * `mkdir`-recursive first (the underlying `createWriteStream` rejects
 * with ENOENT otherwise). Callers needing recursive copy should
 * compose with `readFilesAtDepth` and RxJS `mergeAll(availableParallelism())`
 * the same way `syncAnimeDownloads` and `syncMangaFolders` already
 * do — that gives per-file concurrency control, observable progress,
 * and cancellation that a sequential walker cannot.
 *
 * Pass `options.onProgress` to receive per-chunk byte updates. When
 * omitted, the function takes a fast path that skips the upfront
 * `stat` call and the in-pipeline counting transform.
