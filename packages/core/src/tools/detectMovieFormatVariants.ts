// 2" entries. Index-pairing assumes the user has one file per AniDB
// entry, but with these duplicate listings the pairing depends on
// what the user actually has on disk:
//
//   - 1 file at full length  → keep the Complete entry, drop Parts
//   - N files at partial length → keep Parts, drop Complete
//
// The rename flow can't guess that. detectMovieFormatVariants
// surfaces the ambiguity so the caller can prompt for a choice; if
// no parts pattern is present (the typical TV-series case), it
// returns null and the flow proceeds untouched.
