// Deletes each path in `pathsToDelete`. Intended as the last step of a
// copy-then-cleanup sequence: a prior `copyFiles` step outputs
// `copiedSourcePaths` via `extractOutputs`, which a downstream sequence
// step pipes into this command via `linkedTo`. Emits the deleted path
// string for each entry so the job log shows what was removed.
//
// Is a no-op (emits nothing, completes immediately) when `pathsToDelete`
// is empty — this covers the case where a prior copy step matched zero
// files, so there is nothing to clean up.
//
// Each entry is removed with `{ recursive: true }` so both files and
// directories are handled uniformly; passing a plain file path works
// because Node's `rm` accepts files when `recursive` is set.
